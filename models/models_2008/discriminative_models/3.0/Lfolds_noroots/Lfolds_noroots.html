<h1>Recognition and morphometry Models 3.0 (2011)</h1>

<h2>Models evolution:</h2>

<p>
The 2011 ANN models are a just mode modern variant of the older 2000-2001 models, which differ on the following points:

<li>They are using SVR models (regression SVM, support vector machines) instead of MLP (multi-layer perceptrons), which provide sensibly the same performance but are easier to handle in our machine learning framework.
</li>
<li>They have been trained on the <b>2008 learning database</b> of 62 subjects, which means that they are <b>more accurate</b>, and follow the <b>new sulci nomenclature</b>, like the SPAM-based recognition models.
</li>
</p>

<p>In other respects, they are similar to the <a href="../../../../models_2001/discriminative_models/3.0/Lfolds_noroots/Lfolds_noroots.html">2000-2001 models</a>.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The current models perform about 5% better than the older ones. Here are the error rates estimated via a Leave-One-Out cross-validation:
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Side:</th> <th>SI error:</th> <th>Mass error:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>left</td>
      <td>17.11 ± 4.31</td>
      <td>19.26 ± 4.53</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>right</td>
      <td>16.86 ± 4.78</td>
      <td>19.02 ± 4.89</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<h2>Short description of the descriptors for sulci:</h2>

<p>
The descriptors are the same as the <a href="../../../../models_2001/discriminative_models/3.0/Lfolds_noroots/Lfolds_noroots.html">older models</a>.
