<h1>Lfolds-model-fd4_native and Rfolds-model-fd4_native</h1>

<p>These models are for 3.1 graphs which include cortical thickness information. They may be used for morphometry, but <b>not for sulcal recognition yet</b> because they have not been trained on a suitable database.
</p>

<p>These models are the same as the <a href="../Lfolds_noroots_fd4_2009/Lfolds-model-fd4.html">folds-model-fd4</a> models, except that they provide measurements in the native space of subjects rather than in the normalized Talairach space.
