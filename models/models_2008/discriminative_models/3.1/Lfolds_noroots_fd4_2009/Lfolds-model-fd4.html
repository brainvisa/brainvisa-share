<h1>Lfolds-model-fd4 and Rfolds-model-fd4</h1>

<p>These models are for 3.1 graphs which include cortical thickness information. They may be used for morphometry, but <b>not for sulcal recognition yet</b> because they have not been trained on a suitable database.
</p>

<p>These models provide descriptive figures <b>in Talairach space</b> when possible, which was not always what the older models (2000-2001, FD2) used to do. They are based on the "Fold Descriptors 4" generation, which complete and improve the models based on <a href="../../../../models_2001/discriminative_models/3.0/Lfolds_noroots/Lfolds_noroots.html">"Fold Descriptors 2/3"</a>. Descriptors which are not documented here are documented on those older models documentation.
</p>

<p>We may provide in the future a vartiant of these models which act in native space rather than in Talairach space, which may be useful in some morphometry studies.
