<p>
The 2011 ANN models are a just mode modern variant of the older 2000-2001 models, which differ on the following points:

<li>They are using SVR models (regression SVM, support vector machines) instead of MLP (multi-layer perceptrons), which provide sensibly the same performance but are easier to handle in our machine learning framework.
</li>
<li>They have been trained on the <b>2008 learning database</b> of 62 subjects, which means that they are <b>more accurate</b>, and follow the <b>new sulci nomenclature</b>, like the SPAM-based recognition models.
</li>
</p>

<p>In other respects, they are similar to the <a href="../../Lfolds_noroots_171201/Lfolds_model_noroots_2001.html">2000-2001 models</a>.
</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The current models perform about 5% better than the older ones. Here are the error rates estimated via a Leave-One-Out cross-validation:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Side:</td> <td>SI error:</td> <td>Mass error:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>left</td>
    <td>17.11 ± 4.31</td>
    <td>19.26 ± 4.53</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>right</td>
    <td>16.86 ± 4.78</td>
    <td>19.02 ± 4.89</td>
  </tr>
</table>
