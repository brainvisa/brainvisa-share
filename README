In this directory, you'll find subdirectories that:

1) are needed by more than two software packages and therefore cannot
   belong to any particular package:
   - nomenclature

2) belong to one software package and could therefore be transfered to
   that package in the future, but are also needed by BrainVisa, so for
   now they stay here to easy BrainVisa configuration:
   - hemitemplate     belongs to VIP
   - models           belongs to siggraph
